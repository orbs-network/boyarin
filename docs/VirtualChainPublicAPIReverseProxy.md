# Virtual Chain Public API Reverse Proxy

## Problem

Every node has its own IP and port per virtual chain public API service. How would the client libraries know where to send their API calls?

## Solution

Reverse proxy that allows access to all provisioned virtual chains as a single endpoint for the HTTP API calls for a certain node.

## Implementation

Boyar provisions `http-api-reverse-proxy` service that is an nginx server with the configuration file generated by Boyar based on the list of provisioned virtual chains.

Currently, Boyar does not track particular Docker Swarm node ips and relies on build-in Swarm network routing mechanism and binds proxy calls to external IP of the instance.

All virtual chains can be accessed via URL `/vchains/{vcid}/api/v1/send-transaction`, while direct call to the chain would be `/api/v1/send-transaction` sent to appropriate port.

## Future improvements

`http-api-reverse-proxy` should be placed behind ELB.
